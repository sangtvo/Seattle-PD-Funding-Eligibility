# Project 01: Seattle PD Funding Eligibility
> The analysis aims to gain insight about the logs of emergency 911 calls from the Seattle Police Department reported on March 26, 2016 - March 28, 2016. In addition, the study discusses whether the department will be eligible for additional funding if the minimum standard of 2.5 officers onsite per incident is met.
